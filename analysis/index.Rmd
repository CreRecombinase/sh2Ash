Research website for Sherlock2 project with Jean Morrison, Xin He, and Matthew Stephens. 


## Notes
+ Our first two approaches, the "correlation" and "compound" approach are described [here](sherlock2_compound_and_correlation.pdf)
+ The two factor model is decribed [here](two_factor.html)
+ [Thoughts on a three factor model](three_factor.html)
+ After some difficulty with model comparison using the two and three factor models, I looked into Bayesian model comparison. [here](mh_test.html) are some experiments I did using Metropolis-Hastings to sample from the posterior distribution of the parameters.

## Simulation Experiments

1. Simulations comparing the compound and correlation approaches are [here](compare_approaches.html)
2. Comparing the orignal Sherlock method on the same simulations: [here](sherlock1.html).
3. Running Sherlock v4 (which includes a parameter allowing correlation between summary statistics conditional on the true effect size) on the same simulation: [here](simulations_v4.html)
4. Simulations attempting to answer the question "Can signal be driven by only one or two SNPs": [here](sims_numtop.html). Short answer: Yes but it is less likely than using the original sherlock method or the simple correlation approach.
  
## Application to pairs of GWAS

+ [here](cad_ldl.html) we analyze the relationship between LDL cholesterol and coronary artery disease and between LDL and height using the two-factor model fit by ML.

+ [here](gwas_ss.html) we analyze 15 traits analyzed by Pickerell et al using the two-factor model fit by ML. Also introduces new method for estimating the prior distribution of effect sizes.
