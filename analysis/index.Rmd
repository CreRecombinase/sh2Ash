Research website for Sherlock2 project with Jean Morrison, Xin He, and Matthew Stephens. 

A document briefly descirbing our two approaches can be found [here](sherlock2_compound_and_correlation.pdf).


Simulation Experiments:

1. Simulations comparing the compound and correlation approaches are [here](compare_approaches.html)
2. Comparing the orignal Sherlock method on the same simulations: [here](sherlock1.html).
3. Running Sherlock v4 (which includes a parameter allowing correlation between summary statistics conditional on the true effect size) on the same simulation: [here](simulations_v4.html)
4. Simulations attempting to answer the question "Can signal be driven by only one or two SNPs": [here](sims_numtop.html). Short answer: Yes but it is less likely than using the original sherlock method or the simple correlation approach.
  
Application to real data: 

+ [here](cad_ldl.html) we analyze the relationship between LDL cholesterol and coronary artery disease and between LDL and height.
