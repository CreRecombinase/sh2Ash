Research website for Sherlock2 project with Jean Morrison, Xin He, and Matthew Stephens. 

A document briefly descirbing our two approaches can be found [here](sherlock2_compound_and_correlation.pdf).

+ Simulations comparing the compound and correlation approaches are [here](compare_approaches.html)
+ We compare the orignal Sherlock method on the same simulations [here](sherlock1.html).
  
  
Next we applied the correlation approach to some real data: [here](cad_ldl.html) we analyze the relationship between LDL cholesterol and coronary artery disease.
